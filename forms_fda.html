<p><details><summary>	Current Good Manufacturing Practice; Proposed Amendment of Certain Requirements for Finished Pharmaceuticals	</p></summary><p><small>Tag(s):	Drug			Generic			OTC								</small></p><p>OMB Control Number - 	0910-0139	</p><p>	The Current Good Manufacturing Practices regulations help ensure that drug products meet the statutory requirements for safety and have their purported or represented identity, strength, quality, and purity characteristics. The information collection requirements in the Current Good Manufacturing Practices regulations are necessary to establish accountability in the manufacturing and processing of drug products, provide for meaningful FDA inspections, and enable manufacturers to improve the quality of drug products over time. The CGBP recordkeeping requirements also serve as crucial information if it is necessary to recall a drug product.	</p></details>
<p><details><summary>	Communicating Composite Scores in Direct-to-Consumer (DTC) Prescription Drug Advertising	</p></summary><p><small>Tag(s):	Drug														</small></p><p>OMB Control Number - 	0910-0743	</p><p>	The main goal of the current research is to evaluate how consumers interpret and respond to DTC prescription drug advertising that includes benefit information based on composite scores. Specifically, this research will explore: <br /> <ol><li>Whether consumers are aware of how efficacy is measured for specific drugs;</li><li>How well consumers comprehend the concept of composite scores;</li><li>Whether exposure to DTC advertisements with composite scores influences consumers' perceptions of a drug's efficacy and risk; and </li><li>Different methods for presenting composite scores in DTC ads to maximize consumer comprehension and informed decision-making.</li></ul>	</p></details>
<p><details><summary>	Examination of Online Direct-to-Consumer Prescription Drug Promotion	</p></summary><p><small>Tag(s):	Drug														</small></p><p>OMB Control Number - 	0910-0714	</p><p>	FDA regulations require that prescription drug advertisements include a "fair balance" of information about the benefits and risks of advertised products, both in terms of the content and presentation of the information (21 CFR 202.1(e)(5). All prescription drug promotion that makes claims about a product must, therefore, also include risk information in a "balanced" manner. Currently, there are a number of questions surrounding how to achieve "fair balance" in online direct-to-consumer (DTC) promotion. <br />This project is designed to test different ways of presenting prescription drug risk and benefit information on branded drug websites. This research is relevant to current policy questions and debate and will complement qualitative research we plan to conduct on issues surrounding social media ("Examination of Online Direct-to-Consumer Prescription Drug Promotion"; OMB Control No. 0910-0677). The series of studies described in this notice will provide data that, along with other input and considerations, will inform the development of future guidance.	</p></details>
<p><details><summary>	Experimental Study: Effect of Promotional Offers in Direct-to-Consumer Prescription Drug Print Advertisements on Consumer Product Perceptions	</p></summary><p><small>Tag(s):	Drug														</small></p><p>OMB Control Number - 	0910-0713	</p><p>	This study will examine what effect, if any, the presence of price incentive promotional offers in DTC prescription drug ads have on the following: (1) Consumers' perceptions of product risks and benefits, (2) recall of product risks and benefits, and (3) strongly held beliefs that may act as potential moderators.	</p></details>
<p><details><summary>	Focus Groups about Drug Products	</p></summary><p><small>Tag(s):	Drug														</small></p><p>OMB Control Number - 	0910-0677	</p><p>	The FDA is requesting approval for collecting information through the use of focus groups for studies involving drug products that are regulated by FDA. This information will be used as a first step to explore concepts of interest and assist in the development of quantitative study proposals, complementing other important research efforts in the agency.	</p></details>
<p><details><summary>	Guidance for Industry on Hypertension Indication: Drug Labeling for Cardiovascular Outcome Claims	</p></summary><p><small>Tag(s):	Drug														</small></p><p>OMB Control Number - 	0910-0670	</p><p>	This guidance is intended to assist applicants in developing labeling for outcome claims for drugs that are indicated to treat hypertension. The appropriate use of these drugs can be encouraged by making the connection between lower blood pressure and improved cardiovascular outcomes more explicit in labeling.	</p></details>
<p><details><summary>	Guidance for Industry on Post Marketing Adverse Event Reporting for Nonprescription Human Drug Products Marketed Without an Approved Application	</p></summary><p><small>Tag(s):	Drug														</small></p><p>OMB Control Number - 	0910-0636	</p><p>	This guidance provides information on: (1) the meaning of "domestic Address" for purposes of the labeling requirements of section 502(x) of the act; (2) FDA's recommendation for the use of an introductory statement before the domestic address or phone number that is required to appear on the product label under section 502(x)of the act.	</p></details>
<p><details><summary>	Health Care Professional Survey of Prescription Drug Promotion	</p></summary><p><small>Tag(s):	Drug														</small></p><p>OMB Control Number - 	0910-0730	</p><p>	The present study aims to investigate the perspectives of health care professionals with prescribing privileges--including physicians, physician assistants, and nurse practitioners--regarding various aspects of prescription drug promotion. Specifically, the survey will address DTC advertising, professional promotion, use of new technologies including social media, and the Office of Prescription Drug Promotion's (OPDP's) Bad Ad program. This is the first such study to our knowledge that examines the beliefs of health care professionals other than physicians who now have prescribing privileges. The study findings will inform FDA of relevant issues and concerns relating to health care professional exposure to prescription drug promotion.	</p></details>
<p><details><summary>	Investigational New Drug Regulations	</p></summary><p><small>Tag(s):	Drug														</small></p><p>OMB Control Number - 	0910-0014	</p><p>	Information collection from applicants who apply for approval of an investigational new drug application in order to develop a drug for marketing.	</p></details>
<p><details><summary>	Orphan Drug Regulations	</p></summary><p><small>Tag(s):	Drug														</small></p><p>OMB Control Number - 	0910-0702	</p><p>	Amendments to these regulations are intended to clarify regulatory provisions and make minor improvements to address issues that have arisen since the issuance of the regulations in 1992. They are intended to assist sponsors who are seeking and who have obtained orphan--drug designations, as well as FDA in its administration of the orphan drug program.	</p></details>
<p><details><summary>	Prescription Drug Advertisements	</p></summary><p><small>Tag(s):	Drug														</small></p><p>OMB Control Number - 	0910-0686	</p><p>	This information collection request accounts for FDA's prescription drug advertising regulations at 21 CFR 202.1, which describe requirements and standards for print and broadcast advertisements.	</p></details>
<p><details><summary>	Prescription Drug Marketing Act of 1987; Policies, Requirements, and Administrative Procedures	</p></summary><p><small>Tag(s):	Drug														</small></p><p>OMB Control Number - 	0910-0435	</p><p>	This collection is intended to achieve the goals and ensure compliance with the regulations implementing the Prescription Drug Marketing Act of 1987 (PDMA) (Pub. L. 100-293).	</p></details>
<p><details><summary>	Radioactive Drug Research Committee (RDRC) Report on Research Use of Radioactive Drug Study Summary	</p></summary><p><small>Tag(s):	Drug														</small></p><p>OMB Control Number - 	0910-0053	</p><p>	The information is needed for the collection requirements contained in 21 CFR 361.1. The information will be reviewed to determine the qualifications of the membership and the appropriateness of approved studies. The respondents are the chairpersons, investigators, and members of the approved Radioactive Drug Research Committees.	</p></details>
<p><details><summary>	Registration of Producers of Drugs and Listing of Drugs in Commercial Distribution	</p></summary><p><small>Tag(s):	Drug														</small></p><p>OMB Control Number - 	0910-0045	</p><p>	21 CFR part 207 implements section 510 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the act) (21 USC 360), under which FDA is authorized to establish a system for registration of producers of drugs and for listing of drugs in commercial distribution.	</p></details>
<p><details><summary>	Secure Supply Chain Pilot Program (SSCPP)	</p></summary><p><small>Tag(s):	Drug														</small></p><p>OMB Control Number - 	0910-0729	</p><p>	The Secure Supply Chain Pilot Program (SSCPP) is intended to assist FDA in its efforts to prevent the importation of adulterated, misbranded, or unapproved drugs by allowing the Agency to focus its resources on imported drugs that fall outside the program and that may pose such risks. Such a program would increase the likelihood of expedited entry for specific finished drug products and APIs imported into the United States that meet the criteria for selection under the program.	</p></details>
<p><details><summary>	Study of Clinical Efficacy Information in Professional Labeling and Direct-to-Consumer (DTC) Print Advertisements for Prescription Drugs	</p></summary><p><small>Tag(s):	Drug														</small></p><p>OMB Control Number - 	0910-0692	</p><p>	FDA regulations require that an advertisement that makes claims about a prescription drug include a "fair balance" of information about the benefits and risks of the advertised product, in terms of both content and presentation (21 CFR 202.1(e)(5)(ii)). In past research FDA has focused primarily on the risk component of the risk-benefit ratio. In the interest of thoroughly exploring the issue of fair balance, however, the presentation of effectiveness, or benefit, information is equally important.	</p></details>
<p><details><summary>	FDA Approval to Market a New Drug	</p></summary><p><small>Tag(s):	Drug														</small></p><p>OMB Control Number - 	0910-0001	</p><p>	This information collection request captures the requirements of Section 505 of the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, which requires that a new drug may not be marketed unless the manufacture provides FDA with scientific evidence that the drug is both safe and effective. The regulations at 21 CFR Part 314 provide the means through which pharmaceutical manufacturers can obtain FDA approval of a drug product marketing application, and the means through which FDA can assure the safety and effectiveness of the marketed products.	</p></details>
<p><details><summary>	Adverse Drug Experience Reporting	</p></summary><p><small>Tag(s):	Drug														</small></p><p>OMB Control Number - 	0910-0230	</p><p>	Sections 201, 502, 505, and 701 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act require that marketed drugs be safe and effective. In order to know whether drugs that are not safe and effective are on the market, FDA must be promptly informed of adverse experiences occasioned by the use of marketed drugs. In order to help ensure this, FDA issued regulations at 21 CFR 310.305 and 314.80 to impose reporting and recordkeeping requirements on the drug industry that would enable FDA to take action necessary for protection of the public health from adverse drug experiences.	</p></details>
<p><details><summary>	FDA Approval to Market a New Drug; Revision of Post Marketing Reporting Requirements--Discontinuance	</p></summary><p><small>Tag(s):	Drug														</small></p><p>OMB Control Number - 	0910-0699	</p><p>	The FDA published an interim final rule on December 19, 2011 amending its post marketing reporting regulations implementing certain provisions of the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act). The provisions of the FD&C Act require manufacturers who are the sole manufacturers of certain drug products to notify FDA at least 6 months before discontinuance of manufacture of the products. The interim final rule modified the term "discontinuance" and clarified the term "sole manufacturer" with respect to notification of discontinuance requirements. The broader reporting resulting from these changes will enable FDA to improve its collection and distribution of drug shortage information to physician and patient organizations and to work with manufacturers and other stakeholders to respond to potential drug shortages.	</p></details>
<p><details><summary>	FDA Approval to Market a New Drug: Patient Listing Requirements and Application of 30-month Stays on Approval of Abbreviated New Drug Applications Certifying That...	</p></summary><p><small>Tag(s):	Drug														</small></p><p>OMB Control Number - 	0910-0513	</p><p>	Section 314.50(h) requires that an NDA, an amendment, or a supplement contain patent information described under Section 314.53. Section 314.53 requires that an applicant submitting an NDA, an amendment, or a supplement submit on Forms 3542 and 3542a the required patent information. If a patent is issued after the application is filed with FDA but before the application is approved, the applicant must submit the required patent information on Form 3542a as an amendment to the application, within 30 days of the date of issuance of the patent. Within 30 days after the date of approval of an application, the applicant must submit Form 3542 for each patent that claims the drug substance (active ingredient), drug product (formulation and composition), or approved method of use for listing in the Orange Book. In addition, for patents issued after the date of approval of an application, Form 3542 must be submitted within 30 days of the date of issuance of the patent.	</p></details>
<p><details><summary>	Current Good Manufacturing Practices for Positron Emission Tomography Drugs	</p></summary><p><small>Tag(s):	Drug														</small></p><p>OMB Control Number - 	0910-0667	</p><p>	This information collection includes the following current good manufacturing practices recordkeeping requirements: Batch Production and Control Records; Equipment and Facilities Records; Records of Components, Containers, and Closures; Process Verification; Laboratory Testing Records; Sterility Test Failure Notices; Conditional Final Releases; Out-of-Specification Investigations; Reprocessing Procedures; Distribution Records; and Complaints.	</p></details>
<p><details><summary>	Data to Support Communications to Educate Consumers on How to Safely Purchase Drugs Online	</p></summary><p><small>Tag(s):	Drug														</small></p><p>OMB Control Number - 	0910-0708	</p><p>	FDA will use the data collected under this clearance to inform and evaluate its integrated outreach campaign designed to help consumers safely purchase drugs online. FDA expects the data to provide a baseline the target audience and track ongoing progress toward its online pharmacy campaign goals and objectives. FDA also plans to use the data to help tailor print, broadcast, and electronic media communications to have powerful and desired impacts on target audiences. The data will not be used for the purposes of making policy or regulatory decisions.	</p></details>
<p><details><summary>	Experimental Study of Comparative Direct-to-Consumer (DTC) Advertising	</p></summary><p><small>Tag(s):	Drug														</small></p><p>OMB Control Number - 	0910-0707	</p><p>	The present study aims to investigate how consumers interpret and react to DTC comparative drug ads. Specifically, the study will explore two types of drug comparisons in DTC ads: (1) drug efficacy comparisons and (2) other evidence-based comparisons, such as dosing, mechanism of action, and indication. The study findings will inform FDA of relevant consumer issues relating to comparative DTC advertising.	</p></details>
<p><details><summary>	Experimental Study of Patient Information Prototypes	</p></summary><p><small>Tag(s):	Drug														</small></p><p>OMB Control Number - 	0910-0691	</p><p>	The purpose of this study is to investigate the usefulness of two possible prototypes for patient medication information (PMI). FDA has an interest in providing useful and accessible information to patients when they retrieve their prescriptions at the pharmacy. In order to ensure that a standard format of information is most useful, we propose approaching this issue both qualitatively and quantitatively. These approaches will allow us to provide information about the readability, usefulness, and understandability of the two formats in a variety of populations, including those with the medical condition in question, people with low literacy levels, and members of the general public. We will compare the two prototypes to each other and to the existing Medication Guide format in order to obtain empirically based information about the most comprehensible and preferred document. This study will inform future policy with regard to PMI.	</p></details>
<p><details><summary>	Experimental Study: Disease Information in Branded Promotional Material	</p></summary><p><small>Tag(s):	Drug														</small></p><p>OMB Control Number - 	0910-0724	</p><p>	This project will investigate the effects of adding disease information to branded prescription drug promotional materials on consumer perceptions and understanding. Part of FDA's public health mission is to ensure the safe use of prescription drugs; therefore it is important to communicate the risks and benefits of prescription drugs to consumers in a way that is clear, useful and non-misleading. The results from this project will be used by FDA to inform its understanding of DTC advertising, inform regulatory policy, and may also help to identify areas for further research.	</p></details>
<p><details><summary>	Experimental Study: Examination of Corrective Direct-to-Consumer Television Advertising	</p></summary><p><small>Tag(s):	Drug														</small></p><p>OMB Control Number - 	0910-0737	</p><p>	FDA regulations require prescription drug ads to contain accurate information about the benefits and risks of the drug advertised. When this is not the case, corrective advertising is designed to dissipate or correct erroneous beliefs resulting from a false claim. Corrective advertising is one remedy FDA may request in response to false or misleading prescription drug promotion. <br /> The current project will examine the influence of corrective messages in the realm of consumer directed prescription drug advertising. The study will investigate how variations in corrective advertising may influence consumers' product beliefs. Specifically, the study will focus on the following variables of interest: (1) exposure to corrective, (2) visual similarity between the original and corrective ads, and (3) time delay between the original and corrective ads. The study findings will inform FDA of relevant consumer issues relating to corrective DTC advertising.	</p></details>
<p><details><summary>	Orphan Drugs; Common European Medicines Agency/FDA Application Form for Orphan Medicinal Product Designation (Form FDA 3671)	</p></summary><p><small>Tag(s):	Drug														</small></p><p>OMB Control Number - 	0910-0167	</p><p>	This information is required in the implementation and administration of the Orphan Drug Act, 21 USC, Sections 526-528.

<p><details><summary>	Patent Term Restoration	</p></summary><p><small>Tag(s):	Drug														</small></p><p>OMB Control Number - 	0910-0233	</p><p>	The information collection deals with FDA's patent term restoration regulations on due diligence petitions for regulatory review period revision. When a patented product must receive FDA approval before marketing is permitted, the Patent and Trademark Office (PTO) may add a portion of FDA's review time to the term of a patent. Petitioners may request reductions in the regulatory review time if FDA marketing approval was not pursued with "due diligence.''	</p></details>
<p><details><summary>	Regulations for In Vivo Radiopharmaceuticals Used for Diagnosis and Monitoring	</p></summary><p><small>Tag(s):	Drug														</small></p><p>OMB Control Number - 	0910-0409	</p><p>	FDA is requiring approval of regulations which require manufacturers of diagnostic radiopharmaceuticals to submit information that demonstrates the safety and effectiveness of a new diagnostic radiopharmaceutical or of a new indication for use of an approved diagnostic radiopharmaceutical.	</p></details>
<p><details><summary>	Guidance for Industry: Fast Track Drug Development Programs - Designation, Development, and Application Review	</p></summary><p><small>Tag(s):	Drug	Biologic													</small></p><p>OMB Control Number - 	0910-0389	</p><p>	This guidance is intended to articulate how FDA plans to work with sponsors to facilitate the development and expedite the review of new drugs, including biological products, intended to treat a serious or life-threatening condition and that demonstrate a potential to address an unmet medical need. Under Section 112(b) of FDA Modernization Act of 1997, FDA issued guidance to industry on fast track policies and procedures outlined in Section 506 of the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, other sections of the Public Health Service Act, or implementing regulations.	</p></details>
<p><details><summary>	Prescription Drug Product Labeling; Medication Guide Requirements	</p></summary><p><small>Tag(s):	Drug	Biologic													</small></p><p>OMB Control Number - 	0910-0393	</p><p>	FDA regulations require the distribution of patient labeling, called Medication Guides, for certain prescription human drugs and biological products used primarily on an outpatient basis that pose a serious and significant public health concern requiring distribution of FDA-approved patient medication information. These Medication Guides inform patients about the most important information they should know about these products in order to use them safely and effectively.	</p></details>
<p><details><summary>	Prescription Drug User Fee Cover Sheet; Form FDA 3397	</p></summary><p><small>Tag(s):	Drug	Biologic													</small></p><p>OMB Control Number - 	0910-0297	</p><p>	Under the prescription drug user fee provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the FD&C Act) (sections 735 and 736 (21 USC 379g and 379h)), as amended, FDA has the authority to assess and collect user fees for certain drug and biologics license applications and supplements. The Prescription Drug User Fee Cover Sheet, Form FDA 3397, is required to be included with each applicable new drug application (NDA), biologics license application (BLA), and supplemental application to an NDA or BLA submitted to FDA for review. The Prescription Drug User Fee Cover Sheet is designed to provide the minimum necessary information to determine whether a fee is required for the review of an application, to determine the amount of the fee required, and to account for and track user fees. The information collected is used by FDA's Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER) and Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research (CBER) to initiate the administrative screening of new drug applications, biologics license applications and/or supplemental applications to those applications.	</p></details>
<p><details><summary>	Requirements on Content and Format of Labeling for Human Prescription Drug and Biological Products	</p></summary><p><small>Tag(s):	Drug	Biologic													</small></p><p>OMB Control Number - 	0910-0572	</p><p>	FDA regulations governing the format and content of labeling for human prescription drug and biological products requiring that the labeling of new and recently approved products contain highlights of prescribing information, a table of contents for prescribing information, reordering of certain sections, minor content changes, and minimum graphical requirements.	</p></details>
<p><details><summary>	Final Guidance for Industry on Oversight of Clinical Investigations: A Risk-Based Approach to Monitoring; Availability	</p></summary><p><small>Tag(s):	Drug	Biologic	Device												</small></p><p>OMB Control Number - 	0910-0733	</p><p>	The guidance assists sponsors of clinical investigations in developing risk-based monitoring strategies and plans for investigational studies of medical products, including human drug and biological products, medical devices, and combinations thereof. The guidance makes clear that sponsors can use a variety of approaches to fulfill their responsibilities for monitoring investigator conduct and performance in investigational new drug (IND) studies conducted under 21 CFR part 312 or investigational device exemption (IDE) studies conducted under 21 CFR part 812. The guidance describes strategies for monitoring activities performed by a sponsor, or contract research organizations (CROs), that focus on the conduct, oversight, and reporting of findings of an investigation by clinical investigators. The guidance recommends strategies that reflect a risk-based approach to monitoring that focuses on critical study parameters and relies on a combination of monitoring activities to oversee a study effectively. For example, the guidance specifically encourages greater reliance on centralized monitoring methods, where appropriate.	</p></details>
<p><details><summary>	Certification to Accompany Drug, Biological Product, and Device Applications or Submissions	</p></summary><p><small>Tag(s):	Drug	Biologic	Device		Animal										</small></p><p>OMB Control Number - 	0910-0616	</p><p>	Sponsors of investigational new drug applications (IND) and marketing applications (NDA, BLA, PMA, 510k, HDE) are required, under the FDA Amendments Act of 2007, to certify that all applicable requirements have been met.

<p><details><summary>	Over-the-Counter Human Drugs; Labeling Requirements	</p></summary><p><small>Tag(s):							OTC								</small></p><p>OMB Control Number - 	0910-0340	</p><p>	Regulations established in March 1999 (21 CFR 206.66) define format and content requirements for the labeling of over-the-counter (OTC)drug products. Specifically, these requirements apply to labeling within the Drug Facts panel required for all OTC drug products (i.e., "Drug Facts" labeling). All OTC drug products except sunscreens have been required to comply with the labeling requirements set forth in 21 CFR 206.66 since June 2005. Complying with these regulations imposes a burden on the manufacturers of new OTC drug products. The burden consists of preparing new labeling for these products that complies with the Drug Facts labeling requirements	</p></details>
<p><details><summary>	Sun Protection Factor (SPF) Labeling and Testing Requirements for Over-the-Counter (OTC) Sunscreen Products	</p></summary><p><small>Tag(s):							OTC								</small></p><p>OMB Control Number - 	0910-0717	</p><p>	Under the 2011 final rule, OTC sunscreen products are required to be tested according to the SPF test procedure in 21 CFR 201.327(i). The SPF test demonstrates a product's effectiveness in protecting against sunburn. A product's numerical SPF value, as determined by the SPF test, reflects the level of sun protection provided by the product. The 2011 final rule requires that an OTC sunscreen product be labeled with its SPF value on its principal display panel according to labeling requirements in 21 CFR 201.327(a)(1). Requiring labeling with SPF values allows consumers to compare the levels of sunburn protection between sunscreen products. The requirement to label OTC sunscreen products with an SPF value determined by the SPF test results in an information collection with a third-party disclosure burden for manufacturers of OTC sunscreen products covered by the final rule. <br />The 2011 final rule also lifts the delay of implementation date of the Drug Facts regulation (21 CFR 201.66) for all OTC sunscreens effective June 18, 2012. Compliance with the Drug Facts regulation results in an additional third-party disclosure burden for manufacturers of OTC sunscreen products covered by the final rule.	</p></details>

NLEA regulations establish general requirements for voluntary health claims, i.e., statements in food labeling that characterize the relationship between a food substance and a disease or health-related condition (21 CFR 101.14(a)(1)). Under the petition process for new health claims (21 CFR 101.70), petitioners must submit scientific evidence supporting a proposed health claim to FDA for review. If FDA determines that there is significant scientific agreement (SSA) among experts that the proposed health claim is supported by the totality of publicly available evidence, FDA issues a regulation authorizing the claim (21 CFR 101.14(c)-(d)). <br />Prior research has not investigated how consumers interpret labeling claims using phrases such as "certain cancers" and "anticarcinogenic effects," or whether qualifiers, such as a listing of site-specific cancers, would eliminate potential deception. The agency therefore proposes an experimental study to examine consumer reactions to health claims using those phrases, with and without various disclaimers. The objective of this proposed study is to collect quantitative data to examine consumer interpretations of two dietary supplement labeling claims, "selenium may reduce the risk of certain cancers" and "selenium may produce anticarcinogenic effects in the body," with and without various disclaimers.	</p></details>

Certain of the provisions of section 403 require that food producers disclose information about themselves or their products on the labels or labeling of their products. FDA has issued various regulations in parts 101, 102, 104, and 105 (21 CFR parts 101, 102, 104, and 105) that also require food producers to disclose certain information on the labels or labeling of their food products. Related regulations require that food producers retain records establishing the basis for the information contained in the label or labeling of their products and provide those records to regulatory officials. Finally, certain regulations provide for the submission of food labeling petitions. FDAs food labeling regulations were issued under the authority of sections 4, 5, and 6 of the Fair Packaging and Labeling Act (the FPLA) (15 USC 1453, 1454, and 1455) and of sections 201, 301, 402, 403, 409, and 701 of the act (21 USC 321, 331, 342, 348, and 371). Most of the regulations in Parts 101, 102, 104, and 105 derive from the requirements of section 403 of the act, which provides that a food product shall be misbranded if, among other things, its label or labeling fails to bear certain required information concerning the food product, is false or misleading in any particular, or bears certain types of unauthorized claims. The disclosure requirements and other collections of information in the regulations in parts 101,102,104, and 105 are necessary to ensure that food products produced or sold in the United states are in compliance with labeling provisions of the act and the FPLA.	</p></details>

The methods by which produce is grown, harvested, and processed may contribute to its contamination with pathogens and, consequently, the role of the produce in transmitting foodborne illness. Factors such as the high degree of handling and mixing of the product, the release of cellular fluids during cutting or mashing, the high moisture content of the product, the absence of a step lethal to pathogens, and the potential for temperature abuse in the processing, storage, transport, and retail display all enhance the potential for pathogens to survive and grow in fresh-cut produce.<br />FDA recognizes the need for guidance specific to the processing of fresh -cut fruits and vegetables. The guidance document entitled " Guide to Minimize Minformation collectionobial Food Safety hazards of Fresh cut Fruits and Vegetables", provides FDAs recommendations to fresh -cut processors about how to avoid contamination of their product with pathogens. Two general recommendations in the guidance are for operators to develop and implement both a written Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) plan and a Sanitary Standard Operation Procedures (SSOPs) plan. SOPs and SSOPs are important components to properly implemented and monitored Good Manufacturing Practices (GMPs) that are required for processed food operations under part 110. Other recommended programs that require documentation and record keeping are recall and trace back programs. In the event of a food safety concern, processors who adopt these recommended programs will be prepared to recall products from the market place or be able to trace back fresh produce, which might be implicated in a foodborne illness outbreak, to its source. The recommended procedures contained in the guidance are voluntary.	</p></details>

HACCP is a preventive system of hazard control that can be used by all food processors to ensure the safety of their products to consumers. A HACCP system of preventive controls is the most effective and efficient way to ensure that these food products are safe. FDAs mandate to ensure the safety of the nation`s food supply is derived principally from the Federal Food Drug and Cosmetic Act (the act)(21 USC 321, et seq.). Under the act, FDA has authority to ensure that all foods in interstate commerce, or that have been shipped in interstate commerce, are not misbranded or deceptively packaged; under section 701 (21 USC. 371), the act authorizes the agency to issue regulations for its efficient enforcement. The agency also has authority under section 361 of the Public Health Service Act (42 USC 264) to issue and enforce regulations to prevent the introduction, transmission, or spread of communicable diseases from one State to another State.	</p></details>

The regulations providing for uses of irradiation in the production, processing, and handling of food are found in part 179 (21 CFR part 179). To ensure safe use of a radiation source, 179.21(b)(1) requires that the label of sources bear appropriate and accurate information identifying the source of radiation and the maximum (or minimum and maximum) energy of radiation emitted by x-ray tube sources. Section 179.21(b)(2) requires that the label or accompanying labeling bear adequate directions for installation and use and a statement supplied by FDA that indicates maximum dose of radiation allowed. Section 179.26(c) requires that the label or accompanying labeling bear a logo and a radiation disclosure statement. Section 179.25(e) requires that food processors who treat food with radiation make and retain, for 1 year past the expected shelf life of the products up to a maximum of 3 years, specified records relating to the irradiation process (e.g., the food treated, lot identification, scheduled process, etc.)	</p></details>

In 1997, FDA amended its regulations in part 25 (21 CFR part 25) to provide for categorical exclusions for additional classes of actions that do not individually or cumulatively have a significant effect on the human environment (62 FR 40570, July 29, 1997). As a result of that rulemaking, FDA no longer routinely requires submission of information about the manufacturing and production of FDA-regulated articles. FDA also has eliminated the previously required Environmental Assessment (EA) and abbreviated EA formats from the amended regulations. Instead, FDA has provided guidance that contains sample formats to help industry submit a claim of categorical exclusion or an EA to the Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition (CFSAN). The guidance document entitled, Preparing a Claim of Categorical Exclusion or an Environmental Assessment for Submission to the Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition identifies, interprets, and clarifies existing requirements imposed by statute and regulation, consistent with the Council on Environmental Quality regulations (40 CFR 1507.3). It consists of recommendations that do not themselves create requirements; rather, they are explanatory guidance for FDAs own procedures in order to ensure full compliance with the purposes and provisions of NEPA.	</p></details>

Authority for providing such assistance is derived from section 311 of the Public Health Service Act (42 USC 243). In addition, FDA's mission under section 903(b)(2)(A) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the Act) (21 USC 393(b)(2)(A)) includes ensuring that foods are safe, wholesome, and sanitary, and section 903(b)(4) of the Act directs FDA to cooperate with food retailers, among others, in carrying out this part of its mission. <br />The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has identified the major contributing factors associated with foodborne illness outbreaks. Five of these contributing factors directly relate to retail and foodservice establishments and are called "foodborne illness risk factors" by FDA. In an effort to assist State, local, and Tribal regulators and the retail and food service entities they regulate, FDA has developed a Program Standards document entitled, "Voluntary National Retail Food Regulatory Program Standards." <br />The Program Standards were developed with extensive input from state, tribal, and local regulatory authorities and are intended to help those authorities design and manage a retail food regulatory program that is focused on the reduction of foodborne illness risk factors. They are intended to capture the best management practices currently in use by state, tribal, and local regulatory authorities. The Program Standards initiative represents a comprehensive strategic approach that will help ensure the safety and security of the food supply at the retail level.	</p></details>

FDA helps consumers make informed dietary decisions by regulating nutrition information in food labeling, initiating its own consumer education activities, and collaborating with public and private entities in conveying nutrition information to consumers. These activities are aimed at influencing consumer awareness, understanding, and behaviors related to diet and nutrition and ultimately health outcomes of the Nation. <br />	The Nutrition Labeling and Education Act (NLEA), which amended the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, requires most foods to bear nutrition labeling and requires food labels that bear nutrient content claims and certain health messages to comply with specific requirements. There are three different types of claims that the food industry can voluntarily use on food labels. Although they are regulated differently, they all must be truthful and not misleading. <br />FDA is proposing to conduct an experimental study to quantitatively assess consumer reactions to different whole grain statements. The purpose of the study is to help enhance FDA's understanding of consumer comprehension and perceptions of food labels that use whole grains labeling statements. The study is part of the agency's continuing effort to enable consumers to make informed dietary choices and construct healthful diets. The results of the study will be used for informing possible measures that the agency may take to help consumers make such choices."	</p></details>

Section 417 of the act defines "reportable food" as an "article of food (other than infant formula) for which there is a reasonable probability that the use of, or exposure to, such article of food will cause serious adverse health consequences or death to humans or animals." (Section 417(a)(2) of the act). Section 417 of the act requires FDA to establish an electronic portal (the Reportable Food electronic portal) by which instances of reportable food must be submitted to FDA by responsible parties and may be submitted by public health officials. FDA made the decision that the most efficient and cost effective means to implement the requirements of section 417 of the act relating to the Registry was to utilize the business enterprise system currently under development within the agency: the MedWatch Plus Portal. In addition, Section 1005(f) of FDAAA required FDA to issue guidance to industry about submitting reports through the electronic portal of instances of reportable food and providing notifications to other persons in the supply chain of such article of food. FDA is issuing guidance containing questions and answers relating to the requirements under section 417 of the act, including (1) how, when and where to submit reports to FDA; (2) who is required to submit reports to FDA; (3) what is required to be submitted to FDA; and (4) what may be required when providing notifications to other persons in the supply chain of an article of food.	</p></details>

Manufacturers of these tobacco products may submit a report under section 905(j)(1)(A)(i) demonstrating that their new tobacco product is substantially equivalent to a predicate tobacco product. <br />FDA issued a guidance document with recommendations on preparing substantial equivalence reports in which a tobacco manufacturer must show that a new tobacco product is substantially equivalent within the meaning of section 910 to a tobacco product commercially marketed in the U.S. as of February 15, 2007, or to a tobacco product that the Secretary has previously determined is substantially equivalent and in compliance with the Act. The comparison product chosen by the tobacco product manufacturer is referred to by FDA as the predicate tobacco product. For 905(j)(1)(A)(i) reporting, the new tobacco product is compared to a single predicate tobacco product to determine substantial equivalence. <br />Section 905(j)(1)(A)(i) requires manufacturers who wish to demonstrate substantial equivalence for tobacco products commercially marketed after February 15, 2007 to include in their reports recommendations for providing information comparing the characteristics of the new and predicate tobacco product, including: 1) materials, 2) ingredients, 3) design, 4) composition, 5) heating source, or 6) other features. FDA recommends how to submit a section 905(j)(1)(A)(i) report in the issued guidance to ensure that manufacturers have time to prepare their 905(j) reports.	</p></details>
<p><details><summary>	Requirements under the Comprehensive Smokeless Tobacco Health Education Act of 1986, as amended by the Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act	</p></summary><p><small>Tag(s):						Tobacco									</small></p><p>OMB Control Number - 	0910-0671	</p><p>	This information collection--the submission to FDA of warning plans for smokeless tobacco products--is statutorily mandated. The Smokeless Tobacco Act requires that the warnings be displayed on packaging and advertising for each brand of smokeless tobacco "in accordance with a plan submitted by the tobacco product manufacturer, importer, distributor, or retailer" to, and approved by, FDA. The warning plans will be reviewed by FDA, to determine whether the companies' plans for the equal distribution and display of warning statements on packaging and the quarterly rotation of warning statements in advertising for each brand requires, among other things, that all smokeless tobacco product packages and advertisements bear one of four required warning statements. The Act does not specify the means for submission of warning plans. There are three ways to submit warning plans: electronic format submitted via the FDA Electronic Submission Gateway; electronic format submitted on physical media (e.g., CD or DVD); or paper format.	</p></details>
<p><details><summary>	Tobacco Health Document Submission	</p></summary><p><small>Tag(s):						Tobacco									</small></p><p>OMB Control Number - 	0910-0654	</p><p>	FDA guidance on this collection requested health documents that were created during the period of June 23, 2009, through December 31, 2009. FDA is in the process of revising the April 2010 guidance but will continue collecting documents created during the period of June 23, 2009 through December 31, 2009, from any manufacturers, importers, or their agents who still have documents to submit. The information collected will inform FDA's development of good manufacturing practices, review standards for new tobacco products, and regulation of modified risk tobacco products, among others. Respondents submit information through a facilitative electronic form or in paper form using Form FDA 3743. In both forms, FDA is requesting the following information: Submitter identification, submitter point of contact, submission format and contents (as applicable), confirmation statement, document categorization (as applicable), document readability and accessibility, and document metadata.	</p></details>

<p><details><summary>	Tobacco Products, Exemptions From Substantial Equivalence Requirements	</p></summary><p><small>Tag(s):						Tobacco									</small></p><p>OMB Control Number - 	0910-0684	</p><p>	On June 22, 2009, the President signed the Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act (Tobacco Control Act) (Public Law 111-31) into law. The Act amended the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the FD&C Act) by adding a chapter granting FDA authority to regulate the manufacture, marketing, and distribution of tobacco products to protect the public health and to reduce tobacco use by minors. <br />The Tobacco Control Act requires that before a new tobacco product may be introduced or delivered for introduction into interstate commerce, one of the following must occur: 1) a premarket application under section 910(b) of the FD&C Act must be submitted to FDA, and FDA must issue an order finding that the new product may be introduced or delivered for introduction into interstate commerce under section 910(c) of the FD&C Act; or 2) a report under section 905(j) of the FD&C Act demonstrating the new tobacco product's substantial equivalence to an appropriate predicate product must be submitted and FDA must issue an order finding the new product to be substantially equivalent to the predicate product and in compliance with the requirements of the Tobacco Control Act. <br />This rule implements section 905(j)(3) of the FD&C Act, as amended, which states that FDA may exempt tobacco products that are modified by adding or deleting a tobacco additive, or increasing or decreasing the quantity of an existing tobacco additive, from the requirement of demonstrating substantial equivalence if the agency determines that (1) such modification would be a minor modification of a tobacco product that can be sold under the FD&C Act, (2) a report demonstrating substantial equivalence is not necessary to ensure that permitting the product to be marketed would be appropriate for the protection of public health, and (3) an exemption is otherwise appropriate. Section 905(j)(3)(B) of the FD&C Act requires FDA to issue regulations implementing this provision by July 1, 2011.	</p></details>
<p><details><summary>	Channels of Trade Policy for Commodities with Residues of Pesticide Chemicals for Which Tolerances Have Been Revoked, Suspended, or Modified by the EPA	</p></summary><p><small>Tag(s):															</small></p><p>OMB Control Number - 	0910-0562	</p><p>	FDA's guidance, "Channels of Trade Policy for Commodities With Residues of Pesticide Chemicals, for Which Tolerances Have Been Revoked, Suspended, or Modified by the Environmental Protection Agency Pursuant to Dietary Risk Considerations," represents the agency's current thinking on its planned enforcement approach to the channels of trade provision of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act and how that provision relates to FDA-regulated products with residues of pesticide chemicals for which tolerances have been revoked, suspended, or modified by EPA pursuant to dietary risk considerations. <br /> FDA anticipates that food bearing lawfully applied residues of pesticide chemicals that are the subject of future EPA action to revoke, suspend, or modify their tolerances, will remain in the channels of trade after the applicable tolerance is revoked, suspended, or modified. If FDA encounters food bearing a residue of a pesticide chemical for which the tolerance has been revoked, suspended, or modified, it intends to address the situation in accordance with provisions of the guidance. <br />In general, FDA anticipates that the party responsible for food found to contain pesticide chemical residues (within the former tolerance) after the tolerance for the pesticide chemical has been revoked, suspended, or modified will be able to demonstrate that such food was handled, e.g., packed or processed, during the acceptable timeframes cited in the guidance by providing appropriate documentation to the agency as discussed in the guidance document. Examples of documentation which FDA anticipates will serve this purpose consist of documentation associated with packing codes, batch records, and inventory records. These are types of documents that many food processors routinely generate as part of their basic food-production operations.	</p></details>

Because the agency continues to move from a paper/manual submissions process for reporting adverse events to an electronic systems process, the scope of the information collection is limited to those product areas for which an electronic portal has been developed. Respondents include both manufacturers and distributers of FDA products, as well as individual consumers. The information collected enables FDA to identify potential public health threats and implement mitigation strategies as appropriate.	</p></details>
<p><details><summary>	Environmental Impact Considerations	</p></summary><p><small>Tag(s):															</small></p><p>OMB Control Number - 	0910-0322	</p><p>	FDA is requesting OMB approval for the reporting requirements contained in the FDA collection of information "Environmental Impact Considerations." <br />The National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) (42 USC 4321-4347) states national environmental objectives and imposes upon each Federal agency the duty to consider the environmental effects of its actions that will significantly affect the quality of the human environment. The FDA NEPA regulations are contained in 21 CFR part 25. All applications or petitions requesting Agency action require the submission of a claim for a categorical exclusion or an environmental assessment (EA). <br />This collection of information is used by FDA to assess the environmental impact of Agency actions and to ensure that the public is informed of environmental analyses. Firms wishing to manufacture and market substances regulated under statutes for which FDA is responsible must, in most instances, submit applications requesting approval. Environmental information must be included in such applications for the purpose of determining whether the proposed action may have a significant impact on the environment. Where significant adverse effects cannot be avoided, the Agency uses the submitted information as the basis for preparing and circulating to the public an EIS, made available through a Federal Register notice also filed for comment at the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). If the Agency finds that no significant environmental effects are expected, the Agency prepares a FONSI. <br />The respondents to this collection are primarily from the private sector businesses.	</p></details>

<p><details><summary>	Agreement for Shipments of Devices for Sterilization	</p></summary><p><small>Tag(s):			Device												</small></p><p>OMB Control Number - 	0910-0131	</p><p>	Nonsterile medical devices that are labeled as sterile but are in interstate transit to a facility to be sterilized are normally considered by the FDA to be adulterated and misbranded. FDA regulations established a control mechanism by which firms may manufacture and label medical devices as "sterile" at one establishment and ship the devices in interstate commerce for actual sterilization at another establishment, a practice that facilitates the processing of devices and is economically necessary for some firms. Manufacturers and sterilizers may sign an agreement containing instructions for maintaining accountability of the number of units in each shipment, acknowledgment that the devices are nonsterile and are being shipped for further processing, and specifications for the product's sterilization processing. This agreement allows the manufacturer to ship adulterated or misbranded products to be sterilized without initiating regulatory action and provides FDA with a means to protect consumers from use of nonsterile products. The agreement must include: (a) Instructions for maintaining accountability of the number of units in each shipment; (b) acknowledgment that the devices are nonsterile, being shipped for further processing; and (c) specifications for sterilization processing. These agreements must be retained for two years, as FDA may review them up to two years after final shipment or delivery of devices.	</p></details>

The FDA is seeking approval for the new reporting burden associated with requests for additional review of decisions and actions by CDRH employees as described in this guidance. Individuals outside of FDA who disagree with a decision or action taken by CDRH employees and wish to have it reviewed or reconsidered have several processes for resolution from which to choose, including: requests for supervisory review of an action, petitions, and hearings. Of these, by far the most commonly used is a request for supervisory review under 21 CFR 10.75 (a "10.75 appeal"). Section 517A of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act), added by section 603 of the FDA Safety and Innovation Act of 2012, includes new requirements pertaining to the process and timelines for 10.75 appeals of "significant decisions" regarding 510(k) premarket notifications, applications for premarket approvals (PMAs), and applications for investigational device exemptions (IDEs). In this guidance document, the term "significant decision" will refer to significant decisions pertaining to these submissions.	</p></details>
<p><details><summary>	Export of Medical Devices - Foreign Letters of Approval	</p></summary><p><small>Tag(s):			Device												</small></p><p>OMB Control Number - 	0910-0264	</p><p>	Exportation of an unapproved device may be permitted under certain circumstances if the exportation is not contrary to the public health and safety and it has the approval of the foreign country to which it is intended for export. Requesters communicate (either directly or through a business associate in the foreign country) with a representative of the foreign government to which they seek exportation, and written authorization must be obtained from the appropriate office within the foreign government approving the importation of the medical device. An alternative to obtaining written authorization from the foreign government is to accept a notarized certification from a responsible company official in the United States that the product is not in conflict with the foreign country's laws. This certification must include a statement acknowledging that the responsible company official making the certification is subject to certain statutory provisions that make it a criminal offense to knowingly and willingly make a false or fraudulent statement, or make or use a false document, in any manner within the jurisdiction of a department or agency of the United States. The respondents to this collection of information are companies that seek to export medical devices. FDA's estimate of the reporting burden is based on the experience of FDA's medical device program personnel.	</p></details>

<p><details><summary>	Bar Code Label Requirements for Human Drug Products and Biological Products	</p></summary><p><small>Tag(s):		Biologic													</small></p><p>OMB Control Number - 	0910-0537	</p><p>	FDA regulations at 21 CFR 201.25 requires bar codes on the labels of most human prescription drug products and on certain OTC drug products. Most of the information collection resulting from this regulation is covered under existing OMB control numbers. This information collection only requests OMB approval for waiver requests from the bar code requirement. A request that FDA waive the bar code requirement for a particular drug product must include the following information: (1) Compliance with the bar code requirement would adversely affect the safety, effectiveness, purity, or potency of the drug or not be technologically feasible, and the concerns underlying the request could not reasonably be addressed by measures such as package redesign or use of overwraps; or (2) an alternative regulatory program or method of product use renders the bar code unnecessary for patient safety.	</p></details>
<p><details><summary>	Adverse Event Reporting for Licensed Biological Product; and General Records	</p></summary><p><small>Tag(s):		Biologic													</small></p><p>OMB Control Number - 	0910-0308	</p><p>	The primary purpose of FDA's Adverse Event Reporting (AER) system is to identify potentially serious safety problems with licensed biological products, focusing especially on newly licensed products. Although premarket testing discloses a general safety profile of a new drug's comparatively common adverse effects, the larger and more diverse patient populations exposed to the licensed biological product provides, for the first time, the opportunity to collect information on rare, latent, and long-term effects. AER reports are obtained from a variety of sources, including manufacturers, patients, physicians, foreign regulatory agencies, and clinical investigators. <br />The general recordkeeping provisions require manufacturers of licensed biological products for human use to maintain records of each step in the manufacture and distribution of products. The recordkeeping requirements serve preventative and remedial purposes by establishing accountability and traceability in the manufacture and distribution of products.	</p></details>
<p><details><summary>	General Licensing Provisions: Biologics License Application, Changes to an Approved Application, Labeling, Revocation and Suspension, and Forms FDA 356h and 2567	</p></summary><p><small>Tag(s):		Biologic													</small></p><p>OMB Control Number - 	0910-0338	</p><p>	Manufacturers are required to submit a license application for review and approval prior to marketing a biological product in interstate commerce. In addition, manufacturers must submit to FDA advertising and promotional labeling. Manufacturers are also required to submit changes, including labeling, changes to an approved application, as well as advertising and promotional labeling changes. The information submitted to FDA in a biologics license application (BLA), supplement to an approved application, or other similar submission is used to determine if a product is safe, effective, and not misbranded under prescribed, recommended, or suggested conditions of use. Forms FDA 356h and 3567 have been developed for use by the industry to insure that all the required and necessary information concerning licensing and labeling is submitted to FDA. <br />The regulations also describe the types of post marketing studies that require status reports, the information to be included in the reports, and the type of information that FDA would consider appropriate for public disclosure. FDA uses the information submitted from the reports of post marketing studies to meet its reporting obligations under section 506B of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act and section 130(b) of the FDA Modernization Act and corresponding regulations.	</p></details>
<p><details><summary>	Biological Products: Reporting of Biological Product Deviations and Human Cells, Tissues, and Cellular and Tissue-Based Product Deviations; Form FDA 3486 and Addendum 3486A	</p></summary><p><small>Tag(s):		Biologic													</small></p><p>OMB Control Number - 	0910-0458	</p><p>	FDA requires certain manufacturers to report all biological product deviations (BPDs) and human cells, tissues, and cellular and tissue based products (HCT/P) deviations in manufacturing for distributed products. The objectives of the BPD reporting and HCT/P deviation reporting requirements are to: (1) Enable FDA to respond when public health may be at risk; (2) expedite reporting of BPD and HCT/P deviations in manufacturing; (3) provide FDA with uniform data to track trends that may indicate broader threats to the public health; (4) create a uniform reporting requirement that can be enforced against non-complying entities; and (5) help ensure that licensed manufacturers and unlicensed blood establishments as well as manufacturers of HCT/Ps are taking appropriate actions to investigate and correct biological product deviations. Reporting of BPDs and HCT/P deviations will also enable FDA to identify areas in which further regulation or guidance is needed to assist licensed manufacturers and unlicensed blood establishments as well as non-reproductive HCT/P establishments in decreasing the occurrence of these events. Form FDA 3486 and 3486A were developed to facilitate FDA's review of the BPD and HCT/P deviation reports.	</p></details>

<p><details><summary>	Experimental Study of Format Variations in the Brief Summary of Direct-to-Consumer (DTC) Print Advertisements	</p></summary><p><small>Tag(s):		Biologic													</small></p><p>OMB Control Number - 	0910-0703	</p><p>	Section 502(n) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act specifies that ads for prescription drugs and biological products must provide a true statement of information "in brief summary" about the advertised product's "side effects, contraindications, and effectiveness." The prescription drug advertising regulations (21 CFR ? 202.1(e)(3)(iii); Appendix B) specify that the information about risks must include each specific side effect and contraindication from the advertised drug's FDA-approved labeling, including the Warnings, Precautions, Adverse Reactions, and other relevant sections. Some of the current approaches to fulfilling the brief summary requirement, while adequate from a regulatory perspective, result in ads that may be difficult to read and understand when used in consumer-directed promotion. <br />In recent years, FDA has become concerned about the adequacy of the brief summary in DTC print advertisements for prescription drugs. Because the regulations do not specify how to address each risk, sponsors can use discretion in fulfilling the brief summary requirement under ? 202.1(e)(3)(iii). Frequently, sponsors print in small type, verbatim, the risk-related sections of the approved product labeling (also called the package insert, professional labeling, prescribing information, and direction circular).	</p></details>

<tr><td>	0910-0609	</td><td>	Guide to Minimize Food Safety Hazards for Fresh-cut Fruits and Vegetables	</td><td>	Fresh-cut fruits and vegetables are fruits and vegetables that have been processed by peeling, slicing, chopping, shredding, coring, trimming, or mashing, with or without washing or other treatment, prior to being packaged for consumption. The methods by which produce is grown, harvested, and processed may contribute to its contamination with pathogens and, consequently, the role of the produce in transmitting foodborne illness. Factors such as the high degree of handling and mixing of the product, the release of cellular fluids during cutting or mashing, the high moisture content of the product, the absence of a step lethal to pathogens, and the potential for temperature abuse in the processing, storage, transport, and retail display all enhance the potential for pathogens to survive and grow in fresh-cut produce.<br /><abbr title="Food and Drug Administration">FDA</abbr> recognizes the need for guidance specific to the processing of fresh -cut fruits and vegetables. The guidance document entitled " Guide to Minimize M<abbr title="Information Collection Review">ICR</abbr>obial Food Safety hazards of Fresh cut Fruits and Vegetables", provides <abbr title="Food and Drug Administration">FDA</abbr>s recommendations to fresh -cut processors about how to avoid contamination of their product with pathogens. Two general recommendations in the guidance are for operators to develop and implement both a written Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) plan and a Sanitary Standard Operation Procedures (SSOPs) plan. SOPs and SSOPs are important components to properly implemented and monitored Good Manufacturing Practices (GMPs) that are required for processed food operations under part 110. Other recommended programs that require documentation and record keeping are recall and trace back programs. In the event of a food safety concern, processors who adopt these recommended programs will be prepared to recall products from the market place or be able to trace back fresh produce, which might be implicated in a foodborne illness outbreak, to its source. The recommended procedures contained in the guidance are voluntary.	</td></tr>

This GitHub.io landing page is provided to raise awareness about GitHub activity across the Department and federal government such that developers do not need to be familiar with the government's [organizational structure](http://www.hhs.gov/about/orgchart/) in order to find health and human services related developer tools.

Included here are links to GitHub Accounts that are related to Department of Health & Human Services ([HHS](www.hhs.gov)) [operating divisions](http://www.hhs.gov/about/foa/opdivs/index.html), [staff offices](http://www.hhs.gov/about/foa/osleadership/index.html), and [programs](http://www.hhs.gov/about/programs/index.html).
